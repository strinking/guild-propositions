# 1: Community Voting System

## Description:
A system (perhaps a bot/channel) where users can propose ideas/concerns
which can then be voted on by other members of the community and propositions
that have a positive reaction are then reviewed by staff who make the final
descision.

## Example:
A user wants another user to become a staff member, they propose this using the
aforementioned system, the community votes and if there is a greater number of
supporting votes, staff members then decide whether or not to implement the
result of the referendum.

## Pros:
* No need for members to have indirect access to the same power as staff 
* Allows for the community to voice their concerns
* Much more efficient way of proposing ideas than #meta

## Cons:
* Prone to abuse (like all community-based systems)
* Might only represent a *very* small percent of the community (i.e. 5-8 active members and 10-15 people who vote)
* Might be challenging to get the community to participate
